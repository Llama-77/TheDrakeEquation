                <p>     
                        A prevalent topic in today's society is the question of whether aliens exist. 
                        You may have seen this concept being <em>"creatively"</em> explored in many books and movies.
                        While the fiction surrounding the concept of extraterrestrials are wild and at times borderline unrealistic.
                        It does not mean we can simply dismiss the possible existence of aliens. 
                        We truly do not know anything;
                        there is no evidence to support either side of the argument which draws us wondering with billions of possiblities.
                        It's no wonder this topic is so dense.
                <p>
                        However this topic has spread, it reached its inflection point as common pop culture when science started looking into evidence for extraterrestrial existence (albeit it may have had assistance from the moon landing and the space craze). 
                        The second most famous equation, after E<sup>2</sup> = m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup> + p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> (the proper version of E=mc<sup>2</sup>), is what piqued the scientific community towards searching for extraterrestrial life. 
                        We are of course talking about the Drake Equation.
                        Derived by renowned astronomer and pioneer of ‘the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence’ (SETI) Frank Drake himself.
                </p>

                <p>
                        In 1960, Drake conducted humanity’s very first modern attempt to detect interstellar radio transmissions (Shostak 2021), Project Ozma. 
                        However, Project Ozma was deeply underfunded and understaffed as Drake wished not to attract criticism towards his efforts.
                        After Project Ozma he continued his experiments; searching from the directions of other stars and defining the different hints he was looking for.
                        These experiments would eventually inspire him to derive the famous Drake Equation and host the founding meeting of SETI (as well as adjure adequate funding).
                </p>

                <p>
                        In 1961, Drake held the meeting where he made his equation public. 
                        The famous astrophysicist Carl Sagan, physicist Phillip Morrison as well as the biochemist Melvin Calvin who was absent in receiving the Nobel Prize to attend this historic meeting. 
                        Melvin Calvin received a call to inform him he won the Nobel Prize (he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work founding the Calvin cycle).
                        To be clear his intentions were not to scientifically prove anything, just to simply bring up a scientific discussion regarding the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. 
                        Specifically how we would go about looking for evidence as well as wondering whether there is <em>any</em> intelligent extraterrestrial life at all.
